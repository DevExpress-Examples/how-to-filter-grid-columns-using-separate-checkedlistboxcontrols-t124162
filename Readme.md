# How to filter grid columns using separate CheckedListBoxControls


This code example illustrates how to create separate CheckedListBoxControls filled with unique column values and filter a grid via checking items. To get column unique values, the <strong>DataController.GetUniqueColumnValues</strong> method is used. Please note that the GridView.DataController property is hidden from IntelliSense, and you need to type it manually.
